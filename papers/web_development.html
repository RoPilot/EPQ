For this reason, one of the priorities was to create a hidden page that allowed me to input all the needed parameters for a page, and it automatically create the HTML (Web Language) so I simply have to copy and paste. In addition, creating references can be confusing amongst lots of text, in the form of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements. Therefore, when you highlight certain text within this page builder, the site prompts you for all the necessary information to create a reference, and creates it for you. To keep all of the necessary data for each page, I needed to include a .JSON file, which meant that you can search, as well as organise pages easily. Therefore, this extra page creates a .JSON that you can very easily append into the main Manifest.json file. <a reference="How I make My Pages" full_reference="How I Create A Research Paper Quick and Easy" id="reference" href="page_builder/index.html">Test It Out Here</a><div id="follower"></div></p>
